I will say a few things about my hobby.
I really like soccer and I actively play soccer in the afternoons after school. Not only that, I also love to watch soccer and update football news, that's why I redesigned a soccer website when I studied my web 1 subject. In addition, I have a hobby of going home every week, it makes me dispel fatigue and have fun moments with family.
<p>Do you like me?</p>
